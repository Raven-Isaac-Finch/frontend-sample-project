A sample project with Material UI


<!-- **There was no info regarding the contact page so I modified Dashboard on top left to navigate to the contact page. 

**There was no info regarding the sidebar popup, so you can display it by hitting the Dashboard breadcrumb

**Skipped this: Please check if characters entered are valid and inform the user (e.g. red/green border) because users cant enter anything other than numbers -->
