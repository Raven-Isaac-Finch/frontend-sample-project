# frontend-sample-project

The project is live here at: https://frontend-sample-project.netlify.app

However, if you would like to get it working locally, feel free to clone the repo.

The project was created via <ins>create-react-app</ins>, so the layout is pretty much the same.

```
 npm install
```

for modules, followed by

```
 npm start
```

Should do the trick.

  

You can also find **.gitignore** file inside the project.

### <ins>**Notes**</ins>

+ **Regarding Responsive Design:** Mobile design is based on <ins>iPhone 12 Pro</ins>.

+ There was no information regarding the contact page and how to access it; therefore, I modified "Dashboard" on top left corner of the page to navigate to the contact page.

  

+ There was no information regarding the access to the sidebar popup in mobile devices; therefore, I buildt it so that you can display it by hitting the Dashboard breadcrumb at the top.
   + _TR country list is taken from Google Translate to save time, there might be slight translation issues._

+ After submitting the contact form, the country output is <ins>country's name</ins> instead of <ins>its code</ins>.

***

+ **Skipped Feature:** I skipped the validation process of the characters for the phone number field in contact page because the user is not allowed to enter any characters other than numbers.
